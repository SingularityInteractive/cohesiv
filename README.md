Adhesive is a multi-tier, microservice architecture built to supplement Gloo's monolith
with services useful to third-party clients, without modifying Gloo's core codebase.

This is intended to be a sample cloud-native application to showcase the best
practices in application deployment, products of [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
and test new features.

Adhesive is written in [Go](https://golang.org), but can host services in any language with docker, 
uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io) for communication between microservices. It runs on [Google
Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and uses Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage,
[Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/), [Cloud
Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/), [Stackdriver
Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/) and [Stackdriver
Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/).

**Local development**
